## **Introduction to Obsei**

### **What is [Obsei](https://www.obsei.com/)?**

**Obsei** (Observability for Sentiment and Insights Extraction) is an open-source, modular framework designed to simplify data extraction, processing, and analysis. It allows developers to create highly customizable NLP pipelines for sentiment analysis, summarization, keyword detection, and more.

Its **pluggable architecture** integrates seamlessly with various data sources (e.g., websites, social media, or APIs) and outputs processed insights to desired destinations like dashboards, databases, or messaging systems.

### **Why Use Obsei?**
- **Efficient Automation**: Streamlines repetitive data collection and analysis tasks.
- **Scalability**: Processes vast datasets with minimal configuration.
- **Cost-Effective**: Open-source with no licensing costs.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multi-language analysis and domain-specific customizations.

## **Core Features**

### 1. **Data Extraction**
- Fetches structured and unstructured data from:
  - Websites using web crawlers (e.g., Trafilatura).
  - Social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit.
  - File-based sources or APIs.

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis**
- **Binary or Multi-Class Sentiment Classification**:
  - Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiment detection.
  - Multilingual support using models like `distilbert-base-multilingual-cased`.

### 3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
- Identifies and classifies:
  - **People** (e.g., CEOs, politicians).
  - **Organizations** (e.g., companies, NGOs).
  - **Locations** (e.g., cities, countries).
  - Merges fragmented entities for clean outputs.

### 4. **Summarization**
- Generates concise summaries from large text inputs using models like `BART`.
- Dynamically adjusts summary lengths based on input complexity.

### 5. **Keyword and Topic Extraction**
- Detects recurring themes, topics, or phrases from text.

### 6. **Customizable Pipelines**
- Mix and match sources, analyzers, and sinks to build workflows for specific use cases.

---

## **Technical Foundations**

### **Architecture**
Obsei operates through three core components:
1. **Sources**:
   - Fetch raw data (e.g., TrafilaturaCrawlerSource for web scraping).
2. **Analyzers**:
   - Perform NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, summarization, and NER.
3. **Sinks**:
   - Output processed insights to destinations (e.g., dashboards, databases).

### **NLP Models and Mathematics**
- **Transformer Models**:
  - BERT-based models (e.g., DistilBERT, BART) leverage self-attention mechanisms for language understanding.
- **NER**:
  - Token classification using fine-tuned models like `bert-large-cased`.
- **Summarization**:
  - Sequence-to-sequence frameworks (e.g., `BART`) encode and decode text into summaries.

### **Technologies**
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Provides state-of-the-art NLP models.
- **Trafilatura**: Handles web scraping and content cleaning.
- **Python Pipelines**: Orchestrates data flow seamlessly.

## **Business Applications**

### 1. **Customer Feedback Analysis**
- Detect trends in reviews, survey responses, or social media mentions.
- Extract actionable insights like common complaints or satisfaction drivers.

### 2. **Competitor Monitoring**
- Analyze sentiment and keywords in competitor news or advertisements.
- Uncover market opportunities and risks.

### 3. **Marketing Campaign Evaluation**
- Assess public sentiment during and after campaigns.
- Detect negative messaging by competitors.

### 4. **Crisis Management**
- Monitor real-time sentiment to guide public relations strategies.
- Detect early signs of potential PR crises.

### 5. **Product Development**
- Analyze feedback to prioritize product features.
- Identify pain points using sentiment-weighted analysis.

## **How Obsei Works**

### **Step-by-Step Workflow**

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Extracts data from specified sources (e.g., web articles, tweets).
2. **Language Detection**:
   - Determines the language of the input text dynamically.
3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Processes text using transformers for sentiment classification, NER, and summarization.
4. **Output Routing**:
   - Saves or forwards insights to desired destinations (e.g., Slack, Elasticsearch).

---

## **Extending Obsei**

### **Customization**
- Replace pre-trained models with domain-specific ones.
- Add new sources (e.g., LinkedIn data scraping) or sinks (e.g., Power BI integration).

### **Advanced Use Cases**
- **Predictive Analytics**:
  - Forecast trends based on historical sentiment data.
- **Behavioral Analysis**:
  - Analyze customer support interactions for intent prediction.

---

### **Fact Checking**
- We use Google Fact Check tool to validate negative statement pointing to any individual or organization, country.
- Using Google Fact Check API to send query on real time looking up for data credibility on an instant.
