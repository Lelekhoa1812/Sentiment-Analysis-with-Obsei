### **Technical Components**

#### 1. **Sources**
Data collection is the starting point for any analysis. Obsei provides flexible sources like:
- **TrafilaturaCrawlerSource**: For scraping and cleaning web content.
- **Social Media APIs**: (e.g., Twitter and Facebook).
- **File-based Sources**: Text files or logs.

#### 2. **Analyzers**
Analyzers are at the core of Obsei's processing pipeline, enabling various NLP tasks:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses Hugging Face's DistilBERT for polarity classification.
- **NER (Named Entity Recognition)**: Extracts structured information like people, organizations, and places.
- **Text Summarization**: Utilizes Facebook’s BART or mBART for summarization.

#### 3. **Sinks**
Once insights are generated, they can be sent to:
- **Dashboards**: Real-time visualizations via BI tools.
- **Databases**: Store results in systems like MySQL, MongoDB, or Elasticsearch.
- **Notifications**: Push insights to messaging platforms like Slack or email.

### **Background Technologies**

#### 1. **Hugging Face Transformers**
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**:
  - A foundational transformer architecture for NLP.
- **DistilBERT**:
  - Optimized for speed and memory, perfect for sentiment tasks.
- **BART and mBART**:
  - Designed for text-to-text generation tasks like summarization and translation.

#### 2. **Trafilatura**
- A Python library specialized in web scraping, handling dynamic content extraction while discarding irrelevant data like ads or scripts.

#### 3. **Pipelines and Workflow**
- Obsei’s pipeline abstracts data flow from source to sink, reducing development overhead for NLP projects.
