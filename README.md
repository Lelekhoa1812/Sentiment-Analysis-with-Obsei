# Sentiment Analysis with Obsei

This project leverages the **Obsei framework** along with **Hugging Face Transformers** to perform sentiment analysis, entity extraction, and summarization on web articles. By combining advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project delivers actionable insights that can be directly applied to various business and strategic use cases.

## **Objective**

The primary goal of this project is to analyze web content and provide:
1. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Determine the polarity of an article (positive vs. negative sentiment) with associated confidence scores.
2. **Key Phrase Extraction**:
   - Identify the main topics and themes in the text.
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
   - Detect people, organizations, and locations mentioned in the text.
4. **Summarization**:
   - Create a concise representation of the article for quick understanding.

## **How Obsei Works**

### 1. **Overview**
Obsei (Observability for Sentiment and Insights) is an open-source framework designed for:
- **Data collection**: Extracting data from various sources, such as web articles, social media, reviews, and more.
- **Analysis pipelines**: Applying NLP techniques like sentiment analysis, NER, and classification.
- **Customizable sinks**: Sending processed insights to various destinations (e.g., databases, dashboards, or messaging apps).

### 2. **Technical Components**
Obsei simplifies the complex process of setting up NLP pipelines by integrating:
- **Sources**: Tools to fetch data (e.g., `TrafilaturaCrawlerSource` for crawling web pages).
- **Analyzers**: Pre-trained models to analyze sentiment, classify content, and detect entities.
- **Sinks**: Tools to output or store processed results.

### 3. **Algorithms and Tools**
- **Transformer Models**: Hugging Face's transformers are used to leverage state-of-the-art language models such as:
  - **DistilBERT**: A smaller, faster variant of BERT, optimized for multilingual sentiment analysis.
  - **BART**: A model designed for text summarization and text generation tasks.
  - **BERT-NER**: Used for entity recognition in text, detecting people, organizations, and locations.
- **Trafilatura**: A Python library for extracting and cleaning web content, ensuring only relevant text is processed.
- **Pipelines**: Obsei organizes these tools into seamless workflows for efficient data processing and analysis.

## **Use Cases for Businesses**

### 1. **Media Monitoring**
- Track public sentiment around brands, competitors, and industry trends.
- Extract key entities like competitors or market leaders for actionable intelligence.

### 2. **Customer Feedback Analysis**
- Process reviews and comments to detect sentiment trends.
- Extract pain points (e.g., frequent issues or dissatisfaction areas).

### 3. **Market Research**
- Analyze news articles or blogs to uncover emerging trends or sentiments in target markets.
- Perform multilingual analysis for global insights.

### 4. **Policy and Decision Making**
- Summarize complex articles to aid in quick decision-making.
- Detect stakeholders and focus areas in policy-related discussions.

### **Benefits for Businesses**
- **Time-saving**: Automates repetitive manual tasks such as data scraping, processing, and summarization.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides sentiment and trends that can be acted upon directly.
- **Scalability**: Processes multiple data sources with ease, supporting businesses of any size.
- **Customization**: Pipelines can be fine-tuned for domain-specific tasks.

## **Project Workflow**

### 1. **Content Extraction**
- **Tool**: `TrafilaturaCrawlerSource`
- **Task**: Fetches clean, structured content from web pages.

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis**
- **Tool**: `TransformersSentimentAnalyzer`
- **Model**: `distilbert-base-multilingual-cased`
- **Task**: Analyzes text to classify sentiment as positive or negative with confidence scores.

### 3. **Additional Analysis**
- **Key Phrase Extraction**:
  - Identifies primary topics using Named Entity Recognition.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
  - Extracts structured entities such as names, places, and organizations.
- **Summarization**:
  - Uses Facebookâ€™s BART model to generate concise summaries.

### 4. **Output**
- All results are saved in `output_example.txt`, including processed text, sentiment data, key phrases, named entities, and summaries.
